# kiva_seaborn_project

This was a project based on a dataset from Kaggle. It demonstrates the ease of using Seaborn to create beautiful and informative visualizations. These are actually quite simple to use, but they are far more visually pleasing than matplotlib. 

The dataset includes information about loan awards given out by the nonprofit, Kiva.
